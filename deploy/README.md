# How to Deploy POA Bridge Contracts

In order to deploy bridge contracts you must run `npm install` to install all dependencies. For more information, see the [project README](../README.md).

1. Compile the source contracts.
```
cd ..
npm run compile
```

2. Create a `.env` file.
```
cd deploy
cp .env.example .env
```

3. If necessary, deploy and configure a multi-sig wallet contract to manage the bridge contracts after deployment. We have not audited any wallets for security, but have used https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet/ with success.

4. Adjust the parameters in the `.env` file depending on the desired bridge mode. See below for comments related to each parameter.

5. Add funds to the deployment accounts in both theHome and Foreign networks. 

6. Run `node deploy.js`.
